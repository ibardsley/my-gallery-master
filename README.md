Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo? https://stately-travesseiro-0647aa.netlify.app/
- What was your experience? This was the first project where I really felt I had a goo grasp on exactly how I wanted to complete the features and what code I would use.
- What have you learned/improved? I learned some better skills with CSS grid to be able to make the pictures more responsive as the page shrinks or get bigger.
- Your wisdom? :) Keep practicing and it will get easier and easier it just takes time.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- HTML
- CSS Flex and Grid

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/gcbWLxG6wdennelX7b8I) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.


## Acknowledgements

- [Steps to replicate a design with only HTML and CSS](https://devchallenges-blogs.web.app/how-to-replicate-design/)
- I used the W3 schools article about css grid items to better understand how to make the pictures extend across multiple rows or columns. I also used them to have the picture expand or retract based on the height and width of the grid.
